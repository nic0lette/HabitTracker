HabitTracker

HabitTracker is a simple Android application that is intended to support keeping track of "habits", either to support or discourage them.

One example would be to to track smoking.  Creating a "habit" for "Cravings" and another for "Cigarettes".  Each time one has a craving, they could count it.  Each time they smoke, they could count that.  Over time they could see how frequently they were able to resist a craving in order to cut down.

Of course it could be used to track how often one uses the stairs.  Or even recording how many calories or grams of fat one ate in a day.

Currently the feature set is rather limited, but I hope to add more over time.
